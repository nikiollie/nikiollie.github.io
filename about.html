          <p class="bold">About Me</p>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm Nicole. I'm a former Software Engineer  <a href="https://www/twitter.com" target="_blank" class="bold">@Twitter</a> and also a current Master's student in the Computer Science department at
            <a href="https://www.ucsd.edu" target="_blank" class="bold">UCSD</a>. 
            In Summer 2021, I worked at Twitter
            as an engineering intern on the Ads Measurement Platform team, and became a full time Software Engineer on the team from 
            July 2022 until Nov 2022. I have previously worked at <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com" target="_blank" class="bold">Qualcomm</a> 
            as a SWE intern on the Connectivity/Stability team and 
            the Audio Processing team. Throughout my undergraduate program at UCSD, 
            I was a computer science tutor for several classes including 
            <a href="http://ieng6.ucsd.edu/~cs12x/" target="_blank" class="bold">CSE 12</a> - 
            Data Structures and <a href="http://ieng6.ucsd.edu/~cs110x/" target="_blank" class="bold">CSE 110</a> - 
            Software Engineering. I was also a head tutor for 
            <a href="http://ieng6.ucsd.edu/~cs15x/" target="_blank" class="bold">CSE 15L</a> - 
            Software Tools.

                    I am extremely passionate about increasing diversity in STEM, especially in CS. 
                    Throughout my undergraduate and graduate experience, I have been involved in 
                    the <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/diversity_equity_inclusion" target="_blank" class="bold">
                    CSE Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Community</a>, and am currently a 
                    graduate student lead. Additionally, I volunteered as a Professional Mentor for the <a href="https://www.techwomen.org/" target="_blank" class="bold">TechWomen</a> program 
                    while I was at Twitter to empower women leaders in STEM from Africa, Central and South Asia, and the Middle East.
                    <br><br>
                    In my undergrad, I was involved in research with the 
                    UCSD <a href="https://knightlab.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank" class="bold">Knight Lab</a> 
                    and the <a href="https://mdavidson.org/" target="_blank" class="bold">Davidson Lab</a>.
