            <div>
            <p> Worked as an Engineering Intern on the Ads Measurement Platform team.
                Modified and deprecated several endpoints from internal backend 
                services for Brand Surveys using Scala and Apache Thrift.
                Improved overall system design, eased on-call load, increased UI 
                performance and helped latency, and reduced maintenance cost and 
                redundancy of internal system.

                    Graded exams and course assignments, held office hours to assist 
                    students who needed help with course material and assignments,

            <div>
            <p> Worked on developing python package ("geodata") to streamline the 
                manipulation of renewable energy resource profiles and land use 
                datasets using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and several Python libraries 
                including geopandas and geoplot. Collected land use layers and other 
                energy datasets in order to find the most suitable regions in 
                India towards the development of renewable energy plants 
                specifically wind/solar such that it's politically suitable and 
                financially viable, and to what extent does building renewables 
                in these regions influence wind and solar potential and the cost 
                premiums to efficiency associated with these changes.

            <p> Worked as a Software Engineering Intern on the Connectivity/Stability team. 
                Designed and developed a web UI with a WSGI server (JavaScript, HTML, CSS,

            <div>
                <p> Characterized metagenomic sequence data through the development of 
                    convolutional neural networks using Python and TensorFlow in order to 
                    improve the overall speed of microorganism identification, since 
                    microbiome research has shown promise in diagnosing illnesses from 
                    the composition of a patient's microbiome. Experimented with CNN 
                    architectures using different numbers of convolutional layers, 
                    pooling layers, and varying filter sizes to determine the most 
                    accurate model.

                <p> Continued research to simulate and classify DNA sequences. Trained 
                    word embedding models, simulated DNA sequence reads, and aligned query 
                    sequences. Worked with dna2vec, a library based on word2vec and developed 
                    my own configuration files to train different models on several types of 
                    archaea and bacteria. Along with dna2vec, also worked with wgsim to 
                    simulate sequence reads from reference genomes, and blastn and bwa for 
                    query sequence alignment.
